# revised-3d-engine
Recreating my previous 3d engine using C++ and dx12 on windows (planning on supporting other platforms and graphics apis in the future)

## Setup
The premake file can be run to generate a solution for this project (in build directory), but before building, ensure that 'Use Debug Libraries' is enabled if in debug mode (for visual studio)

## Plans
* Allow the user to select models
* Implement a first-person free camera
* Slowly implement the features from the previous project into this one
